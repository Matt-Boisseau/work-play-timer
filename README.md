# Work/Play Timer

## How to Use

[Check it out live.](https://matt-boisseau.github.io/work-play-timer/)

Click on <kbd>Work</kbd> before you start being productive. The clock will count up in "worked" time.

Click on <kbd>Play</kbd> before you start taking a break. The clock will count down to 00:00 in "worked" time and back up in "played" time.

Click on <kbd>Pause</kbd> while you're not using the timer. Otherwise, it will continue ticking away, even if you close the window.

## Why?

If you're like me, you are equally wont to work for six hours straight or goof off for an entire day. Using this timer, you can easily see if you've spent way more time on one or the other.

If you like to work and play in even measure, just try to end the day with the timer close to 00:00.

If you need to buckle down and focus, try to keep your "worked" time as high as possible.

If your doctor is warning you about overwork, try to keep your "play" time as high as possible.
